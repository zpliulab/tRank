# tRank:
Tensor-based PageRank (tRank) algorithm is a method for prioritizing disease genes of complex disease, which is by integrating multi-type single cell RNA-seq data and multilayer gene regulatory networks.
# Decription:
In tRank, an n-mode tensor is introduced as a core to represent the multilayer network, then the n-mode multiplication operation between tensor and vector is adapted to implement the PageRank algorithm.
# Steps and preparation:
##(1) Single cell RNA-seq data preprocess
##(2) Multi-layer network construction
##(3) Combining omics data and network data
##(4) Implement tensor-based PageRank algorithm
##(5) Ranking nodes based on their PageRank values
